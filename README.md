# DDB-YT-Spotify
A program that automates adding songs from the Youtube channel [David Dean Burkhart](https://www.youtube.com/c/daviddeanburkhart) to a Spotify playlist. 

To run the program:
1. Add the Spotify user ID, Spotify API access token, and Youtube Data API key to <b><i>secrets.py</i></b>
2. Run the <b><i>main.py</i></b> file in your terminal. Keep in mind that due to the quota limit of the Youtube Data API, you can only query a maximum of the 50 latest uploads.

I created this program to automate my own music discovery process as well as to delve into working with APIs.
